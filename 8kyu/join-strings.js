// PREP

// ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.
// + , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

function joinStrings(string1, string2){
    // code here
}

// P: the parameter are two strings
// R: we want to return the strings combined without using +, concat, or join and only using new ES6 
// E: n/a
// P: use back ticks and money sign with curley


// my solution 

function joinStrings(string1, string2){
    return `${string1} ${string2}`
}
